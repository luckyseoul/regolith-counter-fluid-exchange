"""
Optimized DEM timestep primitives for CuPy.

Goals:
- Minimize Python loop overhead and host-device synchronizations in the hot path.
- Unconditional device-side clips (no cp.any + host branch inside per-step loop).
- Fuse simple body forces + integrate where easy.
- Support larger N (tens of k particles) to actually use VRAM and keep GPU busy.
- Cell-list friendly.

Usage in a runner:

from common.optimized_step import make_optimized_stepper, unconditional_clips

stepper = make_optimized_stepper(BOX, U_G, DAMP, add_lid_func=None)

for s in range(steps):
    f, tq = compute_forces(...)
    ... drag + distributor ...
    pos, vel, omega = stepper(pos, vel, omega, f, tq, radius, mat, DT)

# only do expensive reductions at log intervals
